# Project: A Visual Sorting Algorithm Simulator

**Objective:** To build a client-side web application that visualizes popular sorting algorithms and allows the user to interact with and compare the performance of these algorithms on different data sets.

**Functionality:**

The user should be able to select different sorting algorithms from a list (e.g. Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Quick sort, etc.).
The user should be able to generate random data sets of varying size for the algorithm to sort.
The user should be able to start, pause, and reset the visualization of the sorting algorithm.
The visualization should show the current state of the data set, highlighting the elements being compared and swapped.
The visualization should include statistics such as the number of comparisons and swaps made, the time taken to sort the data set, etc.

**Skills required:**

Strong HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.
Understanding of algorithms and data structures, specifically sorting algorithms.
Ability to create interactive visualizations with JavaScript.
Knowledge of performance optimization techniques.

**Deliverables:**

A fully functional client-side web application that implements the specified functionality.
A brief report explaining the design choices made, challenges faced, and improvements that could be made in the future.

## About

[**üìö Read this template tutorial! üìö**][template-docs]

This template is designed for compiling Rust libraries into WebAssembly and
publishing the resulting package to NPM.

Be sure to check out [other `wasm-pack` tutorials online][tutorials] for other
templates and usages of `wasm-pack`.

## üîã Batteries Included

* [`wasm-bindgen`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) for communicating
  between WebAssembly and JavaScript.
* [`console_error_panic_hook`](https://github.com/rustwasm/console_error_panic_hook)
  for logging panic messages to the developer console.
* [`wee_alloc`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wee_alloc), an allocator optimized
  for small code size.
* `LICENSE-APACHE` and `LICENSE-MIT`: most Rust projects are licensed this way, so these are included for you
